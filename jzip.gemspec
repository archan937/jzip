Using sprites for images and SASS for stylesheets only left javascripts not be optimized. AssetPackager almost suited the solution, but it hasn't got enough flexibility in configuration. So with AssetPackager (for minification) and SASS (for merging with templates) as inspiration, I came up with Jzip.}
