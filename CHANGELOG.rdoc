* Added more logging info

== Version 0.2.0 (September 19, 2009)

* Refactored the requirements method:
  - enabled using a preleading '/' in the required_source parameter to specify 'RAILS_ROOT/public/javascripts'
  - using a more transparent approach of parsing 'defaults' to Prototype and Scriptaculous sources
  - being able to add predefined sources (such as 'defaults') with great ease
  - only adding a predefined source when the file exists
* Added a preleading '/' to the at installment generated Jzip template
* Not specifying the template location(s) in the Jzip::Plugin.options anymore (this let's you add template locations without having to know the whereabouts of other locations):
  - the locations are stored in a private variable
  - adding a template location has to be done by calling Jzip::Plugin.add_template_location

* Always parsing Jzip templates when on initial compile and options[:minify] is set to true

* Provided the possibility of overruling the Jzip minification by adding an exclamation mark before the required source or defaults (e.g. //= require !foo)

== Version 0.1.0 (August 30, 2009)

* Initial release
