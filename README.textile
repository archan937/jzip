h1. Jzip

A Rails gem for Javascript merging and compression using templates (like SASS)

h2. Introduction

Jzip was created due to the need of simply merging and minifying Javascript files to reduce HTTP requests and file size of my assets. Using sprites for images and SASS for stylesheets only left javascripts not be optimized. AssetPackager almost suited the solution, but I wanted more flexibility in configuration. So with AssetPackager (for minification) and SASS (for merging with templates) as inspiration, I came up with Jzip. At first Jzip was a plugin only, but after refactoring the entire code base, Jzip is now a gem hosted on gemcutter.

h2. Installation

h3. Using Jzip as gem in Rails 3

Add Jzip in @Gemfile@ as a gem dependency:

<pre>
  gem "jzip"
</pre>

Run the following in your console to install with Bundler:

<pre>
  bundle install
</pre>

h3. Using Jzip as gem in Rails 2

Add Jzip in @environment.rb@ as a gem dependency:

<pre>
  config.gem "jzip"
</pre>

Run the following in your console:

<pre>
  sudo rake gems:install
</pre>

h2. Usage

h3. Including generated Javascript files

Just use the @javascript_include_tag@ helper method (e.g. for the @defaults.jz@ template):

<pre>
  <%= javascript_include_tag "defaults" %>
</pre>

h3. Creating Jzip templates / partials

A @.jz@ file (Jzip template or partial) is nothing more than a common .js file in which you can require other files for merging. You can do this by simply adding the following:

<pre>
  //= require < path_to_file or path_to_template or path_to_partial or predefined_set >
</pre>

Just like in Rails views and in SASS, Jzip has partials of which the output file will not be created in the target directory. The path to the Javascript file or Jzip template or partial has to be relative to the Jzip template / partial itself. Please note that specifying a preleading @/@ in the path will be interpreted by Jzip as @RAILS_ROOT/public/javascripts@ (which is very handy).

Other than the path to a Javascript file, you can also refer to a predefined set of Javascripts sources. At the moment, only @defaults@ is available for the Prototype and Scriptaculous libs and application.js which are shipped with a Rails application. Any suggestions for other predefined sets are welcome.

The following instructs Jzip to merge the Prototype and Scriptaculous libraries with three custom Javascript files into @public/javascripts/foo.js@:

*Note*: template is located in @assets/jzip/foo.jz@

<pre>
  //= require shared/top_up
  //= require /defaults
  //= require builder/module
  //= require builder/model_browser
</pre>

Please see "http://github.com/archan937/jzip/tree/master/test/javascripts/assets/jzip/":http://github.com/archan937/jzip/tree/master/test/javascripts/assets/jzip/ for a complete assets directory example.

h3. Registering template locations

You probably already have guessed that the default location for Jzip templates is @RAILS_ROOT/assets/jzip@. I can imagine that you would have choosen another location. So fortunately, the Jzip engine offers you to that piece of freedom. All you have to do is put the following in your @environment.rb@ file:

<pre>
  Jzip::Engine.add_template_location < your_own_template_location(s) >
</pre>

Now isn't that a piece cake? Not only can you pass a @string@ containing the template location, you can also pass an @array of strings@ (containing multiple locations) or a @hash@ (which also specifies the output directory):

* @string@ - target directory will be @public/javascripts@

<pre>
  RAILS_ROOT + "/lib/jzip
</pre>

* @array@ - target directory will be @public/javascripts@

<pre>
  [RAILS_ROOT + "/some/path/jzip", path/to/your/jzip/templates]
</pre>

* @hash@ - target directory will be @public/javascripts/your/target_directory@

<pre>
  {"path/to/your/jzip/templates" => RAILS_ROOT + "/public/javascripts/your/target_directory"}
</pre>

h3. Compile options

Finally, Jzip has some options that you can configure in the @environment.rb@ file:

* @:minify@        - Minify the merged Javascript file using the JSMin library (default: true when in production environment)
* @:always_update@ - Merge (and minify when specified) the Jzip templates on every page request when outdated (default: true when not in production environment)
* @:log_level@     - Which is used for logging, you can pass through the regular Rails log levels (@:error@, @:info@ and @:debug@) and even @:console@ which puts the output in your console (default: nil)

You can specify a Jzip option by putting the following in your @environment.rb@ file:

<pre>
  Jzip::Engine.options[:minify]        = false
  Jzip::Engine.options[:always_update] = true
  Jzip::Engine.options[:log_level]     = :console
</pre>

h3. In the Rails console

You can run the following commands in the Rails console (with @./script/console@):

* @Jzip::Assets.install_defaults@ - which installs @assets/jzip/defaults.jz@ (see "Using Jzip as plugin" for more information)
* @Jzip::Engine.compile_javascript_files@ - which instructs Jzip to compile the Javascript files (this is automatically called at every request)
